_In this article, we'll implement a declarative API to perform tasks belonging to cross-cutting concerns, using auditing as an example.
We'll see how SpEL and Spring AOP allow us to easily intercept invocations throughout a code base and perform arbitrary logic in an
expressive and non-invasive manner._

Let's pretend that we inherited a legacy system. The system is in a dismal state, with every change always at risk of bringing the whole
thing down. One day, there is a business requirement to audit a few dozen methods scattered throughout the code base. After every invocation
of these methods, we should notify an external system every time these methods run, sending a client id and an
operation (`1234`, `"CREATE_USER"`).

The detailed requirements for our auditing example are:

* there are a couple dozen methods to audit, scattered throughout the code base
* the auditing logic is always the same: send a client id and action to an external system
* the client id is always in one of the method arguments, but is sometimes nested inside one of numerous types
* sometimes, a method receives multiple client ids, all of which needed to be audited

One way to change such a system is to identify "seams": "a place where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that
place." [^1] Fortunately for us, our legacy system is built using Spring, so we can rely on this. In Spring, aspect-oriented programming
(via Spring AOP) is a good way of exploiting seams, because AOP is by definition non-invasive, in the sense that you don't have to edit the
advised code when declaring new aspects.

This screams "cross-cutting concern": something that is scattered throughout the code base, with one unique action applying to many methods.
And cross-cutting concerns is just the use case for aspect-oriented programming (AOP). Some Spring projects use this liberally. Think of
Spring Cache. It has a single caching logic, but it can vary its cache names, be applied throughout the code base, and deal with nested
types:

```java
public record MyPojo(Nested nested) {
}

public record Nested(String value) {
}

@Cacheable(cacheNames = "myCache", key = "#argument.nested.value")
public Entity fetchEntity(MyPojo argument) {
  return client.fetchEntity(argument);
}
```

That's pretty similar to what we want. And the good thing is, Spring exposes all the required tooling to build a similar API for ad-hoc use
cases, not just for framework-related logic. Here is the declarative auditing API we are going to build in this article.

```java

@Audit(action = AuditAction.DISABLE_USER_PROFILE, expression = "#requests.![clientId]")
public void disableUsers(List<UserDisableRequest> requests) {
  // ...
}
```

This annotation declares that the `DISABLE_USER_PROFILE` action will be audited with the client ids that are in the `userProfileId`
property of every `UserDisableModel` in the argument list. All in a single line that's expressive, concise, and non-invasive. In the rest of
this article, we'll see how to implement this (spoiler: it's fairly straightforward)...

# Evaluating SpEL expressions

First, a quick primer on SpEL. The expression in the annotation above (`#models.![userProfile]`) can be a bit mysterious. SpEL (Spring
Expression Language) is a DSL that's built into the Spring Framework. Its main use in modern Spring applications is in one-liners that
either drill down in a value (like what we did), or that compute a result from variables. And although SpEL
is [well documented](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref.html), it's not as well known as some
other components of the Spring Framework.

The `#` in `requests.![userProfile]` tells SpEL that the following identifier is
a [variable](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/variables.html). Variables are arbitrary values
that can be set on an `EvaluationContext`. More on that later. The rest of the expression, `.![userProfile]`, is
a [collection projection](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/collection-projection.html). It
tells SpEL to extract the `userProfile` property from each collection element, just like if we were to do:

[//]: # (@formatter:off)
```java
requests.stream().map(UserDisableModel::getUserProfile).toList()
```
[//]: # (@formatter:on)

Evaluating a SpEL expression is simple. First, parse the expression. Second, optionally, construct an `EvaluationContext` so that the
interpreter can access variables.[^2] Third, evaluate the expression:

```java

@Test
void basicSpelExpression() {
  String expression = "#mylist.size";

  Expression parsedExpression = new SpelExpressionParser()
    .parseExpression(expression);

  StandardEvaluationContext context = new StandardEvaluationContext();
  context.setVariable("mylist", List.of(1, 2, 3));

  assertThat(parsedExpression.getValue(context)).isEqualTo(3);
}
```

Already, this simple example can almost support our auditing use case. We just need to bind the method's parameters to SpEL variables.
Luckily, Spring exposes `MethodBasedEvaluationContext`, a subclass of `EvaluationContext` that does just that.

```java
private void doSomething(String myArg) {
}

@Test
void methodParamBinding() throws NoSuchMethodException {
  String expression = "#myArg.length";

  Expression parsedExpression = new SpelExpressionParser()
    .parseExpression(expression);

  MethodBasedEvaluationContext context = new MethodBasedEvaluationContext(
    new Object(),
    getClass().getDeclaredMethod("doSomething", String.class),
    new Object[]{"the argument"},
    new DefaultParameterNameDiscoverer());

  assertThat(parsedExpression.getValue(context))
    .isEqualTo(12);
}
```

This is all we need to bind the arguments of a method invocation to a SpEL evaluation context, parse the expression, and evaluate it. You
might wonder what the `null` argument in this snippet is. It's the context's "root object", but we don't need one for this. Now let's put
this in practice by wiring it into an aspect, so that our auditing logic runs after each annotated method.

# Implementing the audit advice

If you've never worked with Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), let me catch you up very quickly. AOP is often used to implement
cross-cutting functionality, such as metrics, logging, tracing, or in our case, auditing. It has a special vocabulary: "aspects" are
collections of behaviours called "advices" that you can have Spring run before, after, or around invocation of a bean's methods. The
invocations you decide to instrument, or "advise", are called "joinpoints", and you select them with a special expression. This expression,
called a "pointcut", is written in
a [subset of the AspectJ language](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.html). This brief overview
is sufficient for our needs.

Implementing an advice is simple. First, we declare the `@Audit` annotation, and annotate it with `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` so
that it's available at runtime. Second, we enable the relevant machinery by adding `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` on one of your configuration
classes. This is optional if you're using Spring Boot, because the built-in `AopAutoConfiguration` will automatically take care of it.
Third, we declare an advice by annotating a class with `@Advice`. Fourth, we define our aspect
with `@Around`, `@Before`, `@After`, `@AfterReturning`, or `@AfterThrowing`. And fifth, we define a pointcut using the AspectJ language.

```java
// 1. declare the annotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Audit {
  AuditAction action();

  String expression();
}

// 2. enable the machinery
@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
class AuditConfig {
}

// 3. declare an aspect
@Aspect
@Component
public class AuditAspect {

  // 4 and 5. declare the advice and its pointcut
  @AfterReturning("@annotation(auditAnnotation)")
  void audit(JoinPoint joinPoint, Audit auditAnnotation) {
  }
}

```

The pointcut uses the `@annotation` designator to select all methods annotated with `Audit`. Notice that the advice (the `audit()` method)
accepts two parameters. The first one is the `JoinPoint`, that will contain information about the advised method. The second one is
the `@Audit` annotation that is on the advised method. With these two arguments, we will be able to access the SpEL expresssion, in
the `expression` element of the annotation.[^3]

With just these few lines of code, Spring will run our `audit` method before every invocation of a bean method that is annotated
with `@Audit` (except for self-invocations, since Spring only intercepts those in `@Configuration` classes). Moreover, our `audit` method
will have access to the names and values of the advised method's argument. Now, let's see how we can use this information to implement our
auditing logic.

The `audit()` method will look almost like what we saw before: parsing the expression, using a `MethodBasedEvaluationContext` to make
parameters accessible to the SpEL runtime, and finally evaluating the expression and publishing the audit:

```java

private final SpelExpressionParser parser = new SpelExpressionParser(); // reuse the parser
private final AuditService auditService; // inject the bean

@AfterReturning("@annotation(auditAnnotation)")
void audit(JoinPoint joinPoint, Audit auditAnnotation) {
  MethodSignature signature = (MethodSignature) joinPoint.getSignature();

  Expression expression = parser.parseExpression(auditAnnotation.expression());
  EvaluationContext context = new MethodBasedEvaluationContext(
    null,
    signature.getMethod(),
    joinPoint.getArgs(),
    new DefaultParameterNameDiscoverer());

  Collection<String> auditableIds = asStringCollection(expression.getValue(context));
  auditableIds.forEach(id -> auditService.audit(auditAnnotation.action(), id));
}
```

There's one finicky part to this: SpEL is a dynamically typed language, so we can't be sure that the return value will be of the correct
type. In our case, we want to allow `String`, for a single client id, and `Collection<String>`, in case multiple client ids need to be
audited. This is what the `asStringCollection(Object)` does:

```java
private Collection<String> asStringCollection(Object result) {
  Objects.requireNonNull(result, "expression of @Audit evaluated to null");

  return switch (result) {
    case String string -> List.of(string);
    case Collection<?> collection -> {
      collection.forEach(element -> Assert.isInstanceOf(String.class, element,
        () -> "@Audit expression evaluated to collection with non-string element"));
      yield (Collection<String>) collection;
    }
    default -> throw new RuntimeException(
      "@Audit expression evaluated to non-string type %s"
        .formatted(result.getClass().getName()));
  };
}
```

And voilà! We now have a working declarative auditing API that can handle multiple audit events, as well as one or many client ids coming
from arbitrary properties of the audited methods' arguments. This code works, but you shouldn't take my word for it. Instead, I want to show
how we can test this with a lightweight test that will run almost as fast as a unit test.

# Testing the audit aspect

Testing aspects involves starting up a Spring context, as well as the aspect-related machinery that we enabled in the application using
`@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`. We can do this easily with `@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)`,
or `@SpringBootTest(classes = { AuditAspect.class, })`. If you use `@SpringBootTest`, don't forget to specify at least one class in the
`classes` element, so that the test doesn't load the whole application.

There's a few ways of testing aspects, but one way I like is to define a new test bean that will be advised. That way, we can more flexibly
test the aspect, since it's easy to define more methods and test arbitrary expressions if the annotated class belongs to the test. Here is a
minimal setup for such a test:

```java

@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) // boot a very minimal Spring context
@Import({
  AuditAspect.class, // make our aspect a bean
  AuditConfig.class, // we check that our config class 
  // correctly enables the aspect machinery
  AuditAspectTest.TestAuditable.class // this is the test bean
})
class AuditAspectTest implements WithAssertions {

  private static final String USER_ID = "userId";

  // this annotation is new to Spring Framework 6.2,
  // it replaces Spring Boot's @MockBean
  @MockitoSpyBean
  private TestAuditable auditable;

  @MockitoBean
  private AuditService auditService;

  @Test
  void itAuditsTheIdWhenTheExpressionEvaluatesToAString() {
    auditable.createUser(USER_ID);

    verify(auditService).audit(AuditAction.CREATE_USER, USER_ID);
  }

  static class TestAuditable {
    // we can now declare any method, with any expression 
    @Audit(action = AuditAction.CREATE_USER, expression = "#userId")
    void createUser(String userId) {
    }
  }
}
```

I'm not showing the full thing here, but such a test should verify that:

* the audit runs after the method completes normally
* the audit doesn't run after the method throws
* the audit throws an exception if the exception evaluates to something other than a `String` or a `Collection<String>`

You can view the full test suite, including these test cases, along with the rest of the code for this
article [here](https://github.com/LeMikaelF/spel-auditing-blog).

## Improvements

I've tried to keep this article simple, so I've left out some improvements. First, ideally the aspect would parse the expression strings
only once per expression, and cache the result, since parsing can be a costly operation. This can easily be achieved with a
`ConcurrentHashMap<String, Expression>`. Second, in the odd case where the expression would be malformed, or wouldn't evaluate to an
acceptable type, depending on your requirements, you may want to prevent the execution of the method. In that case, the advice should be an
`@Around` method and first evaluate the expression, before invoking the join point. `@Around` advices are a little different, but
they're [well documented](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/advice.html#aop-ataspectj-around-advice).

One other possible improvement is that if the process exits after the advised method has run, but before it has been audited, the audit will
never be published. This might be acceptable for you. If it isn't, there are a few solutions. One solution is to wrap the audited behaviour
and the auditing code in a transaction, if the architecture allows it. Another solution is to use
an [outbox pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html).

# Conclusion

In this article, I showed how you can leverage SpEL and Spring AOP to create a declarative auditing API that is expressive, flexible,
non-invasive. This pattern can be used for other cross-cutting requirements such as tracing, metrics, logging, or security. In fact, for
security, Spring Security already provides `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, `@PreFilter`, and `@PostFilter` annotations that follow this
pattern.

One final thing I would like to stress is that such an API should be tested just as much as anything written in imperative Java. It is easy
to make mistakes, such as annotating an interface instead of its implementation (not supported by the AspectJ language), forgetting to
enable aspects with
`@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` in a non-Boot application, or annotating a method that's not intercepted by a JDK proxy (see the note in
the [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.html#aop-pointcuts-designators)). The
good news is, all these cases are easily caught by a test such as the one above.

I have a few other SpEL-related ideas, so if you enjoyed this article and would like to see more, I'd like to hear about it.
